This exercise is an example of how you would use monte carlo simulations to provide inference for distributions. 

Specifically we work with the distribution of beta1 when there is an omitted variable bias and use the monte carlo method to highlight this bias.

Exercise Outcomes:  
  1. Be familiar with iteration works 
  2. Recognise how **for** loops differ from **while** loops  
  3. Be able to write your own monte carlo simulations using loops  
  4. Understand the use of variables instead of hard coding

Assumed Knowledge:  
  - Performing linear regression using lm()
  - Theory on Omitted Variables Bias  
  


```{r}
# for Loop

N = 1000
n = 10


beta1 = 4
X1.mean = 10
X1.sd = 4

beta2 = -2
gamma0 = 3
gamma1 = 3

e.sd = 5

beta1.hat = 0
beta2.hat = 0

for (i in 1:N) {
    
    X1 = rnorm(n, X1.mean, X1.sd)
    X2 = gamma0 + gamma1*X1 + rnorm(n, sd=e.sd)
    Y = beta1*X1 + beta2*X2 + rnorm(n, sd=e.sd)
    
    model1 = lm(Y ~ X1)
    model2 = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)
    
    beta1.hat = beta1.hat + model1$coefficients[[2]]
    beta2.hat = beta2.hat + model2$coefficients[[2]]
}

beta1.hat = beta1.hat/N
beta2.hat = beta2.hat/N

# normal OLS vs actual
print(c(beta1.hat, beta2.hat))

# Theoretical Unbiased Estimator
print(beta1 + beta2*gamma1)

```
